## üß† Data Storytelling
Between 2020 and 2022, guests rated their hotel experience moderately with an average of 3.60/5, supported by an NPS of 11.43, indicating some customer loyalty but room for improvement. Guest feedback shows staff performance is both a key interaction point and a feedback hotspot, suggesting it plays a major role in guest perception.
